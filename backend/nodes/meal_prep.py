agents/meal_prep_agent.py

Analyses the meal plan and generates an optimised prep schedule.

Logic:
1. Scan all recipes for batch-cookable components
   (grains, proteins, sauces, marinated items)
2. Group by prep day (Sunday for M–W meals, Wednesday for Th–Sa)
3. Generate PrepTask list with duration + storage instructions
4. Sum total prep time and identify which 2 days need prep

 INSTRUCTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Identify components that can be BATCH-COOKED (appear in 2+ meals):
   - Grains (rice, oats, quinoa)
   - Proteins (grilled chicken, boiled eggs, cooked lentils)
   - Bases (tomato sauce, curry base, marinade)
   - Vegetables (roasted, steamed, or blanched)

2. Create prep tasks split across 2 prep days:
   - Sunday prep: covers Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday meals
   - Wednesday prep: covers Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday meals

3. For each PrepTask:
   - Specific task description (quantities + method)
   - Which meals it covers (by dish name)
   - Duration in minutes
   - Storage instruction (container type, days in fridge/freezer)
   - Reheating tip

4. efficiency_notes: overall time savings vs cooking from scratch daily
